# bow-clicker
An attachment for a bow to keep track of how many arrows have been shot.

This project uses an Atmel AVR atmega168P as the controller for the 4 digit 7 segment display that keeps track of the number of arrows shot

This project also uses my personal 'display lib' to write to a 7 segment display. 

# Planned additions

A capacitive switch which will be fired off when an arrow brushes by it. without having to manually click a button.
